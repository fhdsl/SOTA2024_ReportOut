C & D: We asked all respondents "Have you ever read or posted in our AnVIL Support Forum?" C: Raw responses are shown (users could select more than one). Most respondents have not used the AnVIL support forum, but utilization in some form is reported by about 20% of respondents; reading through others’ posts is the most common way of utilizing the support forum within this sample.

Comfort scores for each technology or data feature were averaged within user cohorts to find an average knowledge or comfort score. Except for Galaxy, potential users tend to report lower comfort levels for the various tools and technologies when compared to returning users. Overall, there is less comfort with containers or workflows than using various programming languages and integrated development environments (IDEs). B: We asked all respondents "Where do you currently run analyses?" Respondents could select multiple choices. Institutional HPC and locally run (personal computers) are the most common responses. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is reported as used more than other cloud providers within this sample.
